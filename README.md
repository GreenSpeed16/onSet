# This program allows the user to more easily organize the routes that are set in their climbing gym. To initialize the program, run the script Main.py. On first use, a warning should appear stating that no spreadsheet has been found, and to go to settings. After going to settings, click the choose presets button and fill out all fields. Next, if wanted, click the button that says "Set Ideal Route Curve" to set the ideal spread of grades in your gym. To submit a route, go to the tab that corresponds to the type of route you are submitting (Rope or Boulder), and choose the appropriate options from the dropdowns. Once all options have been selected, click "Submit Route." To delete a route, click the "Delete Routes" button, and select what wall to search by. A list of all routes on that wall will come up, with each route being highlighted red. If a route is seen that the user wants to keep, click on the route and it will turn green. Clicking confirm will delete all routes highlighted red. To see a comparison of the amount of routes in the gym to the ideal amount of routes, click the "Route Graphs" button.
